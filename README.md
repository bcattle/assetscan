assetscan
================

Recursively scans directories looking for HTML and CSS files

Usage: `scan.py dir_to_scan`

Output: `index.html 33: images/img/header_image.jpeg`


TODO 
========

Lots. Understand ways to reference files from javascript,
validate that files actually exist given a supplied static path
and url prefix.
